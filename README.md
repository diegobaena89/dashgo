📝 <a id="project"> **Project** </a>

In this project I decided to create a platform to managing personal collections. In this way, the user will be able to register their collections and share them with people from all over the world. In addition, there is a dashboard where the user can view other user's collections and filter them based on their own preferences, being able to even exchange information about the collections, find items that are missing to complete it and buy/sell collections from other users, also functioning as a marketplace.
